# scripts
Scripts/automation stuff I've had to make for uni/work.
Generally, just basic algorithms that can be run individually and/or don't warrant their own repo.

- `networking/com.py`: Centre of Mass algorithm, specifically for the context of networking. ~2-3hrs of work
- `misc/arrayManipulation.py`: For putting any basic array manipulation functions. 15mins
- `networking/traffic-generation`: Generate fake level-4 level traffic between machines in a schedule that mimics real-life traffic waves, for testing network resiliency
